# IP-Block-List
IPs we block long term and scripts to exploit them.

Contains IP we see abusing our networks, or networks from our customer in a regular basis while abuser address owner do not reply to or seem to not honor abuse notifications.
More addresses are available for our customers. (Mostly addresses from datacenter that honor abuse notifications but still need temporary blocking to keep our customers safe)
